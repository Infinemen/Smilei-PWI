## Introduction to SMILEI
Details of [Smilei](http://www.maisondelasimulation.fr/smilei/index.html) 
>Smilei is a Particle-In-Cell code for plasma simulation. Open-source, collaborative, user-friendly and designed for high performances on super-computers, it is applied to a wide range of physics studies: from relativistic laser-plasma interaction to astrophysics.
## What I want to do
I want to add a plasma-material-interaction (PMI) module into Smilei for magnetic fusion study.
